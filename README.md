# Basic Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This is a collection of reinforcement learning algorithms that do use deep
learning techniques. These are the fundamental algorithms. Each file is a
completely seperately contained algorithm. 

I will continue to expand this with more algorithms. 

I am going to write an accompanying blog post for this soon. 

### Deep Q Networks

### Double Deep Q Networks

### Dueling Deep Q Networks
